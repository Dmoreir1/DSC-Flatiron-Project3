## Business Objective 
Gemtel has recently experienced a decline in customer retention. So we were asked to investigate this decline. We began by investigating the amount of customers that terminated their contracts followed by the factors that had the most influence on customer turnover. And finally, we came up with implementable strategies to minimize customer turnover.  

## 

Our investigation found that of the accounts we researched, 483 customers had churned which was equal to about 14.5% of the client base we sampled.
